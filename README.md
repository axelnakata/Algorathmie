# Algorathmie
After 3 weeks of undergoing the Algorithm Bootcamp, our group named Algo Chaser decided to make an order system for a noodle restaurant for our final project.
We've succesfully completed and meet all the criteria requirement of the material that have been tought in the Algorithm Bootcamp.
Although, there might still be some flaws in the code, we are sure that the code is ready to do a demo run.

When running the file please download the "ALGORATHMIE by Algo Chaser.Cpp" File and also the "date.txt", move them into the same folder and then run the code in the compiler.
After succesfully running the code until the end, there should be another text file in the same folder named "receipt.txt" which is the receipt about the overall order information.
